# Conditions Update for 2018
#### Taking the lead for system interoperability of cancer diagnoses

---------

In 2013, MolecularMatch integrated SNOMED-CT as our technology's primary condition (disease) dataset. For months and years after, oncologists and scientists at MM added a layer of curation so that it fits with modern cancer diagnoses. This included editing and adding new conditions and synonyms, and creating genetic composite conditions. Since then, SNOMED has improved their oncology terms. Also, several open-source disease datasets have been launched; further improving how cancer diagnoses are described and coded.

Matching patients to clinical trials, targeted drugs, and assertion evidence guidelines depends on an accurate diagnoses and consistent interpretation between healthcare systems. Therefore in 2018, we upgraded our condition system, accomplishing the goals of:

1. Allowing cohesive code-based searching to improve EHR/Payer/LIMS integrations.
2. Updating to the most modern data ontologies.
3. Data validation and duplicates merging with pathologist oversight.

---------

MolecularMatch NLP entity extraction and search engines run on ontologies. These include our conditions and findings, our in-house developed [molecular ontology](https://api.molecularmatch.com/#parentLevelMutations) and our global clinical trial aggregation. As our experience with data aggregation has grown, we've developed a protocol that allows for easy integration of big data to enhance our search engines. This high-level protocol is:

1. Acquire datasets in their native form on frequent intervals.
2. Identification strategy and merging to allow diverse inputs and avoid duplicates.
3. Incorporate into our API and other products for broad use.

#### Condition Data Incorporated into MM

Condition terms are now searchable by prefix_code (e.g. `SNOMEDID_255035007`).

| Search Prefix | Dataset Name | Records Count |
|---|---|---|
| SNOMEDID | Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms | **313,940** |
| ICD10 | 10th rev. of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases | **94,127** |
| DOID | DiseaseOntology -- open source medical vocabulary | **12,498** |
| ONCOTREE | OncoTree -- curated cancer type ontology by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center | **627** |

Additional datasets worth integrating are: **ICD9** and **LOINC**. Through DiseaseOntology, we have cross mapping of terms to MeSH, NCI’s thesaurus and OMIM as well.

All datasets are easily updated on new releases. The current SNOMED-CT version is [v20170901 U.S. edition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/RMT/SNOMED+CT+Managed+Service+-+US+Edition+Release+Notes+-+September+2017).

---------

#### Dataset Mapping

We always design a feedback loop between clinical expertise and software automation. We do this by building easy to use, internal data management tools for training from M.D. and Ph.D. curators. This condition data upgrade required more than **300** M.D. pathologist curation hours.

Mapping efforts:

- ICD10 **→** SNOMED -- official map [file](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mapping_projects/snomedct_to_icd10cm.html) implemented w/ manual adjustment.
- OncoTree **→** SNOMED -- MolecularMatch pathologist manually mapped.
- DOID **→** SNOMED -- MolecularMatch pathologist manually mapped.

#### Custom Conditions and Genetic Composites

Only a handful of genetic composite conditions exist in the public datasets, like "EGFR positive NSCLC". At MM, we've created many more composites, which are necessary in our NLP engine for coalescing meaning from medical documents.

#### Lets Use It!

These codes can now be used in the whole MM ecosystem. From the application search, to API queries, to EHR integration.

##### App Search

- `ICD10_D45` = `Polycythemia vera`
- http://app.molecularmatch.com/search/ICD10_D45
- `SNOMEDID_363478007` = `Thyroid cancer`
- http://app.molecularmatch.com/search/SNOMEDID_363478007
- `DOID_1781` = `Thyroid cancer`
- http://app.molecularmatch.com/search/DOID_1781
- `ONCOTREE_AML` = `Acute myeloid leukemia, disease`
- http://app.molecularmatch.com/search/ONCOTREE_AML
